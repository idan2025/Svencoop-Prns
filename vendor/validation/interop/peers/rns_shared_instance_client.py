"""Real-RNS interop smoke client for the local shared-instance interface.

Connects to a running Prns ``LocalServer`` as a stock ``RNS.Reticulum`` shared-instance client (the
pinned reference install): with a fresh config dir and the default ``share_instance = True``, RNS tries
to bind the loopback shared-instance port, fails because the Prns daemon already holds it, and so
connects to it as a local client instead — the exact path Sideband/NomadNet/MeshChat take. It then
announces a destination, which crosses the connection to the Prns daemon as a genuine RNS announce.

Prints ``ANNOUNCED dest=<hex>`` on stdout so the runner can match it against the daemon's ``HEARD``
line. RNS's own logs go to stderr, leaving stdout clean for the one machine-readable line.
